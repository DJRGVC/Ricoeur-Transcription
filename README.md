## Project Overview

This project aims to transcribe the notes and lecture materials of French philosopher Paul Ricoeur using AI-powered handwriting and text recognition technology. The goal is to develop an efficient, scalable solution for digitizing and preserving these important philosophical documents, making them more accessible to scholars and the public.



## Objectives

1. **Handwriting Recognition**: Utilize advanced AI-based tools to transcribe handwritten notes.
2. **Text Processing**: Refine transcribed text for accuracy and readability.
3. **Digitization**: Organize and format the transcriptions for academic use.
4. **Analysis**: Explore methods for analyzing the transcribed data to reveal Ricoeur's thought processes and lecture methodologies.

## Tools and Technologies

- AI-powered handwriting recognition (e.g., OCR models)
- Text analysis libraries and frameworks (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, Tesseract)
- Version control: GitHub

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather Ricoeurâ€™s notes and lecture materials in digital format. (Note: this step is already completed--500 training examples have been annotated prior to my involvement.)
2. **Model Training and Fine-tuning**: Train and fine-tune the AI models on the annotated data (beginning with tools such as Transcribus, but potentially moving to other models as needed).
3. **Transcription**: Run the AI models on the notes to generate text.
4. **Verification**: Manually verify produced texts for accuracy and completeness.
5. **Final Output**: Compile the verified texts for Digital Ricoeur project.
